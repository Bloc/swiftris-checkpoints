## Creating a New Game Project

We're going to need a project to work in. An Xcode project gathers everything your app is going to need into one convenient place. Let's begin by creating a brand new game project in Xcode by doing either of these two things:

* Click **Create a new Xcode project** from the Welcome screen
Or
* Select **File** > **New** > **Project…** from the file menu

When the new project window appears, choose **Game** from under the **iOS** > **Application** category and press **Next**.

The next window beckons you to customize options for your project. Fill out the fields described in the table below:

| Option | Value |
| - | - |
| Product Name | **Swiftris** |
| Organization Name | **<your name\>**, we chose **Bloc** |
| Organization Identifier | **<your name\>.com**, we chose **Bloc.io** |
| Language | **Swift** |
| Game Technology | **SpriteKit** |
| Devices | **iPhone** |

Press **Next** and Xcode will ask where to place your new project. Choose a magical, wonderful directory and then click okay because that's what everything is going to be, *o-kay.*

After saving it should open Xcode to your brand new Swiftris project, specifically to the project properties screen. On this screen, check off the **Portrait** option under **Device Orientation:**. This file is automatically saved so you won't have to do anything further.

### Result

**Run** the default game project by pressing <key>⌘ + R</key> on your keyboard or by clicking the little play button in the top left corner. If a simulator isn't present, Xcode will download one for you before launching the app. Once the simulator launches, you should see something resembling the preview at the top of this checkpoint.

Congratulations, you're infinitely closer to a completed Swiftris game than you were 10 minutes ago. *That's a big deal…* Read on to replace that silly spinning space ship and its drunken pilot.
