### A Guide to Building Tetris in Swift Using SpriteKite

Welcome to Swiftris. Here you will find the content from [Bloc's original Swiftris book](https://www.bloc.io/swiftris-build-your-first-ios-game-with-swift). Each checkpoint corresponds to a markdown file found within this repository. The [completed version of Swiftris](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris) is available on GitHub as well.

This is an educational resource meant for all, feel free to share it with those who have little to no programming experience.

## About Bloc

Bloc is a programming bootcamp whose students attend from the comfort of their homes and at less than half the price of Bloc's conventional competitors. Bloc pairs its students with professional mentors. Our mentors are active developers who pair-program with, and instruct our apprentices in the nuances of software development.

Bloc is the perfect combination of top quality resources and one-to-one mentorship. Bloc instructs in [Full stack](https://www.bloc.io/web-development), [Front end](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development), [iOS](https://www.bloc.io/iOS) and [Android](https://www.bloc.io/android) development. Bloc also offers a [UX design course](https://www.bloc.io/design).
