## The Honesty's Too Much

*Let's get physical*, dear reader. Now that you've had your fill of vaguely touch-related late 70s/early 80s/Einstein references, it's time to touch the screen. No, take your fingers off of this computer monitor, we meant your iPhone's screen. Swiftris does not force the user to idly watch as shapes descend with no purpose, that's called modern art and "It belongs in a museum!"

In order to make Swiftris interactive, we're going to use `UIGestureDetector`s.
