## Downloading Xcode

As of the writing of this Bloc Book, Xcode Beta 3 is the latest version capable of Swift compilation. This version of Xcode is not publicly available to all and therefore possibly difficult to obtain. If you do not have an Apple Developer account capable of accessing the latest Xcode 6 Beta, please click the ninja kitten:

However, if you have paid the wholly worthwhile $99 annual fee, please download the latest version of the Xcode Beta in [your developer portal.](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action) However, if Xcode 6 is now publicly available, please disregard this beta talk and do not click the ninja kitten.

Once you have Xcode downloaded and installed, you're ready for the next checkpoint.
