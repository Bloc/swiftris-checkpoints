## Introduction To Swiftris

Today you will begin *putting the pieces together* for a brand new game–see what we did there? To many, Swiftris resembles not only in name but in nearly every other respect a game written in the early 1980s that to this day continues to be played all around the world. Rest assured, Bloc is absolutely certain that any semblance to said game is merely coincidental.

In all seriousness, this is a Tetris clone written in Swift for the iOS platform. This Bloc Book is meant for educational purposes *only* and we will not be held responsible for any legal recourse taken against you if you so choose to release a copy of Swiftris on the App Store.

>If you do release Swiftris anyway, we wish you the best of luck and may Cthulhu have mercy on your soul.

### Swift

Swift is Apple's latest programming language. In time it will replace Objective-C as the primary language in which iPhone and Macintosh applications are written. Swiftris is written entirely in Swift and this book will present a wide variety of the language's capabilities.

If you are not a programmer, *do not worry.* Regardless of skill level, you will have your very own copy of Swiftris after completing this guide. However, this book does not intend to teach you the language in its entirety. Several aspects of it will be covered in brief and supplemented by external resources.

### SpriteKit

SpriteKit is a set of APIs provided by the iOS SDK which allow native 2D game development from within Xcode itself. Swiftris is powered by SpriteKit and therefore no additional libraries or 3rd party tools will be required to build this great game.

Speaking of Xcode…
