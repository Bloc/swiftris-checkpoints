## Creating a New Game Project

We'll need to create a new project to build Swiftris in. An Xcode project organizes everything your app needs into one convenient place. Let's begin by creating a brand new game project in Xcode by doing either of these two things:

* Click **Create a new Xcode project** from the Welcome screen:

Or
* Select **File** > **New** > **Project…** from the file menu:

When the new project window appears, choose **Game** from under the **iOS** > **Application** category and press **Next**.

The next window beckons you to customize options for your project. Fill out the fields described in the table below:

| Option                  | Value         |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Product Name            | **Swiftris**  |
| Organization Name       | **Bloc**      |
| Organization Identifier | **Bloc.io**   |
| Language                | **Swift**     |
| Game Technology         | **SpriteKit** |
| Devices                 | **iPhone**    |

Press **Next** and Xcode will ask where to place your new project. Choose a magical, wonderful directory, make sure to check **Create Git repository**, and then click **Create**.

After saving it should open Xcode to your brand new Swiftris project, specifically to the project properties screen. On this screen, check off the **Portrait** option under **Device Orientation:**. This file is automatically saved so you won't have to do anything further.

### Result

**Run** the default game project by pressing <key>⌘ + R</key> on your keyboard or by clicking the little play button in the top left corner. If a simulator isn't present, Xcode will download one for you before launching the app.

Congratulations, you're infinitely closer to a completed Swiftris game than you were 10 minutes ago. *That's a big deal*.
